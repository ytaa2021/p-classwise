        title: "Computer Science Senior Seminar",
        day: ['Tuesday'],
        professor: 'Joseph Osborn',
        startTime: 11,
        endTime: 12.25,
        location: "Edmunds 129",
        description: "Reading, discussion and presentation of research papers in an area of computer science. Each student will write a survey paper and must attend the Computer Science Colloquium as requested in CS major requirement. Letter grade only. Satisfies the Speaking Intensive requirement. Prerequisites: Senior standing and two CSCI core courses (including CSCI 101 PO, CSCI 105 PO, and CSCI 140 PO), plus one CSCI upper-division course (either core or elective) and CSCI188 PO. May be repeated for credit. Additional course information for fall 2020."

        title: "Math Methods and Models in Neuro",
        day: ['Monday', 'Wednesday'],
        professor: 'Yuqing Zhu',
        startTime: 11,
        endTime: 12.25,
        location: "Seaver South Laboratory 227",
        description: "In this course, students will be introduced to mathematical and computational methods in contemporary neuroscience, ranging from the study of ion channels and single neurons to networks, systems and behavior. Mathematical concepts are introduced alongside the neurobiology they apply to, emphasizing the close connection between experiment and theory. Students will learn relevant topics from discrete math, calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations as models for neurobiological systems and for data analysis. In the laboratory sections, students will learn how to program in Python to gain hands-on experience in modeling, analysis, and visualization of lecture concepts."

        courseID: "CSCI 054 PO-01",
        title: "Discrete Math and Func. Prog.",
        day: ['Monday', 'Wednesday'],
        professor: 'Tzu-Yi Chen',
        startTime: 11,
        endTime: 12.25,
        location: "Seaver Commons 102",
        description: "A combined course on functional programming and formal proof. Students write programs over a variety of data structures, proving their programs correct with respect to precise logical specifications. Programming topics (and proof topics) range over: recursion (induction); combinatorics; algebraic data types, from lists to trees to abstract syntax trees (structural induction); parsers and interpreters (soundness properties); regular expressions (set theory and language theory). Prerequisites: any CSCI051x PO course or Computer Science AP Exam-A with a score of 5. The course is equivalent to CSCI 052 PO plus CSCI 055 PO. This course and any of the following courses can not both be taken for credit: CSCI 052 PO, CSCI 055 PO, and CSCI 060 HM. Additional course information for fall 2020."
